Before running the app, make sure you have a local PostgreSQL server running.

#### üß© Create Database and User

```sql
-- Step 1: Create the database and user (run from any DB, like 'postgres')
CREATE DATABASE notesdb;
CREATE USER notes_user WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';

-- Step 2: Connect to the newly created database
\c notesdb;

-- Step 3: Grant privileges inside that DB
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO notes_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO notes_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO notes_user;
```
## üß™ Postman Testing
